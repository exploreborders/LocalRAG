RAG Systems Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on the model's trained knowledge, RAG systems can access and incorporate information from external sources in real-time.

Key Components:
1. Document Collection: Gathering relevant documents and data sources
2. Text Processing: Cleaning and preparing text for indexing
3. Embedding Creation: Converting text into vector representations
4. Vector Storage: Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings
5. Query Processing: Handling user queries and finding relevant information
6. Response Generation: Using retrieved context to generate accurate answers

Benefits:
- Improved accuracy with up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucinations in generated responses
- Ability to handle domain-specific knowledge
- Scalability for large knowledge bases

Implementation Steps:
1. Choose appropriate embedding models
2. Select vector database (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)
3. Implement chunking strategies for long documents
4. Design retrieval algorithms
5. Integrate with LLM APIs or local models like Ollama
6. Build user interfaces for interaction

Local RAG with Ollama:
Ollama allows running large language models locally, providing privacy and control. By combining Ollama with RAG techniques, you can create powerful AI assistants that leverage both local computation and external knowledge sources.
